# README

A young, highly enthusiastic student, eager to learn and expand. Over
the last few years of studying, I have acquired the fundamental skills of
programming and software development alongside communicational
and social ones accumulated from various jobs and activities both
inside and outside the domain. Currently, I am looking for ways in
which I could further evolve, not just in the IT domain, but in all realms
of my life.
